Keras is a deep learning API written in Python,
running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.

It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and
providing a delightful developer experience.
The purpose of Keras is to give an *unfair advantage* to any developer
looking to ship ML-powered apps.

Keras is:

-   **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer *cognitive load*
    to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
    Keras focuses on ease of use, debugging speed, code elegance & conciseness,
    maintainability, and deployability (via TFServing, TFLite, TF.js).
-   **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of *progressive disclosure of
    complexity*: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily
    advanced workflows should be *possible* via a clear path that builds upon
    what you've already learned.
-   **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and
    scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA,
    YouTube, and Waymo. That's right -- your YouTube recommendations are
    powered by Keras, and so is the world's most advanced driverless vehicle.
